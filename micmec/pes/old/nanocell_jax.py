This implementation is very generally applicable, but it is slower than the default (``nanocell.py``).
Its slowness is likely due to the computational overhead of ``jax.numpy``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices : numpy.ndarray, shape=(8, 3)
        The coordinates of the surrounding nodes (i.e. the vertices).
    h0 : numpy.ndarray, shape=(3, 3)

    Notes
    -----
    At first sight, the equations for bistable nanocells might seem absent from this derivation.
    They are absent here, but they have been implemented in the ``mmff.py`` script.
    This elastic deformation energy is only the energy of a single metastable state of a nanocell.
