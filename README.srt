The micromechanical model is a coarse-grained force field model to simulate the mechanical behaviour of crystalline materials on a large length scale. MicMec is the first implementation of the micromechanical model, ever. The theoretical groundwork of the model was originally established in: ::

    S. M. J. Rogge, “The micromechanical model to computationally investigate cooperative and 
    correlated phenomena in metal-organic frameworks,” Faraday Discuss., vol. 225, pp. 271–285, 2020.

The micromechanical model has been the main topic of my master's thesis at the `Center for Molecular Modeling <http://molmod.ugent.be/>`_ (CMM). MicMec is, essentially, a simulation package for micromechanical systems. Its architecture is intentionally similar to `Yaff <https://github.com/molmod/yaff>`_, a simulation package for atomistic systems, also developed at the CMM. In the process of building MicMec, the original micromechanical model was modified slightly, to ensure user friendliness, accuracy and flexibility.
