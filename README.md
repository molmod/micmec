The micromechanical model is a coarse-grained force field model to simulate the mechanical behaviour of crystalline materials on a large length scale. MicMec is the first implementation of the micromechanical model, ever.  The theoretical groundwork of the model was originally established in:

> S. M. J. Rogge, “The micromechanical model to computationally investigate cooperative and correlated phenomena in metal-organic frameworks,” Faraday Discuss., vol. 225, pp. 271–285, 2020.

The micromechanical model has been the main topic of my master's thesis at the Center for Molecular Modelling 
(CMM). MicMec is, essentially, a simulation package for coarse-grained, micromechanical systems. Its architecture is intentionally similar to Yaff (https://github.com/molmod/yaff), a simulation package for atomistic systems, also developed at the CMM. In the process of building MicMec, the original micromechanical model was modified slightly, to ensure user friendliness, accuracy and flexibility. All major changes with respect to the original model are listed in the text of my master's thesis. More recent changes and quality-of-life improvements are listed in the documentation.
